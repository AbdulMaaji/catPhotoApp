# catPhotoApp
Day 01 of 100DaysOfCode I made a copy of catPhotoApp following freeCodeCamp lesson plan

I learn;
fieldset

figcaption element

I practice how to;
nest a legend in a fieldset element
nest a figcaption in a figure element
nest an input in a label
and finally how to put necessary attributes in a label
